# How to play

Pro boxer 5 is a fun to play game which combines your regular boxing game with facial recognition. When launching the game, you will be greeted with a menu screen. After pressing any button to start, the game will appear. Use the "B" button on your NES controller to jump, and the "A" button to jump. Your charecter only moves when you do, so move your head from side to side to control their movement. Your objective? Drain the enemies health bar to zero before they beat you.

Good luck and have fun.
